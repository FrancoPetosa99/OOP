# OOP Principles

This README outlines the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that guide the design and implementation of software systems.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the practice of hiding the internal details of an object and providing a public interface for interacting with it. This ensures controlled access to data, enhancing data security and integrity.

## Abstraction

Abstraction involves simplifying complexity by representing only the essential aspects of an object. It allows for the modeling of real-world entities in software and provides a streamlined view of their behavior.

## Inheritance

Inheritance facilitates the creation of new classes based on existing ones. Subclasses inherit attributes and methods from superclasses, enabling the extension or modification of functionality. This promotes code reuse and the organization of objects into a hierarchy.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism enables objects from different classes to respond uniformly to the same message. It allows for the generic treatment of objects of different types, fostering the creation of flexible and extensible code.

# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of five software design principles used to create more maintainable, scalable, and understandable software. These principles are acronyms representing key concepts in object-oriented programming. Below are the five SOLID principles:

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class should have a single responsibility. This means that a class should be focused on performing a specific task and should not have multiple reasons to change. When a class has a single responsibility, the code is clearer and more maintainable.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Classes and modules should be open for extension but closed for modification. This is achieved by allowing new functionalities to be added without modifying the existing code. This encourages software extensibility.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Objects of a derived class should be able to replace objects of the base class without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a subclass should be completely substitutable for its superclass without changes in program behavior. This ensures correct interoperability.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Interfaces should not force classes to provide methods they do not use. Instead of having monolithic interfaces with many methods, it is preferable to have smaller, more specific interfaces. This prevents classes from implementing unnecessary methods.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than low-level modules. This encourages flexibility and the ability to change implementations without affecting high-level modules. Dependency inversion is key to modularity and reusability.

# Design Patterns

Design patterns, in the context of software development, are general and reusable solutions to common problems encountered during the design and implementation of software systems. These patterns represent tested best practices and have been developed over time by experts in the field of software development.

Design patterns provide a structured and commonly accepted approach to solving specific problems in software design. They describe how to organize classes, objects, and relationships between them to achieve an efficient, flexible, and maintainable design.

Design patterns are a valuable tool for software developers as they enable them to address recurring problems efficiently and maintain cleaner, structured, and easily understandable code.
